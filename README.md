# Lorem Ricksum

Wubba Lubba Dub Dub! I'm riggety riggetey sick of fake-ass latin placeholder text.
Time to get schwifty with your text editor son!

Lorem Ricksum is an Atom package that lets you insert a random _Rick and Morty_
quote into your editor just by invoking the name of the smartest drunk in the
multiverse.

Just run `apm install lorem-ricksum` and then type `ricksum` into any editor.

## Advanced usage
Niche audiences may need more quotes and paragraphs that just one. This is now possible using special suffixes. Adding `_p#` to then end of the autocompleted string will add `#` paragraphs instead of just one. You can also add a specific number of quotes by using `_q#`.

In addition, if you frequently find yourself in need of a specific number of lines and quotes, a default amount can now be set in the package configuration.
